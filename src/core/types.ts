// Workflows — a JSON-serializable Workflow → Phase → Task tree (strict three
// levels, positional, no DAG). Two type families share this file: the DEFINITION
// family (pure serializable JSON DATA a UI/LLM authors — behavior is referenced
// BY NAME through a registry, never as inline functions) and the runtime CONTEXT
// / SNAPSHOT / RESULT surfaces the entity tree (W-b) and durable store (W-d) build
// on. One compiled contract (factories.ts) keeps the JSON Schema + guard + parser
// + generator in lockstep with the hand-written definition interfaces. Types are
// the source of truth (AGENTS §2).
//
// Determinism is a FIXED design principle, not a configuration: tasks within a
// phase are concurrent; phases are sequential. The only per-phase concurrency
// knob is `concurrency` — an optional resource throttle (max-in-flight), never a
// sequencing control.

 * the three execution forms a task can take, discriminated by `via` (the axis is
 * the execution MECHANISM, never a bare `kind`; AGENTS §4.4). Each form references
 * its behavior BY NAME through a registry (the runner resolves the name at W-b);
 * a definition NEVER inlines a function, so the whole tree stays JSON-serializable.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - `function` — a registered function the runner invokes directly.
 * - `tool` — a registered {@link ToolInterface} the
 *   runner executes as a tool call.
 * - `agent` — a registered agent (a subagent). It will later carry a depth/cycle
 *   guard (W-c, bounded by {@link import('./constants.js').MAX_WORKFLOW_DEPTH}); in
 *   W-a it is purely the typed reference.
 *
 * `name` is the registry key (it identifies the behavior the form runs). A
 * descriptive `via` literal (not `kind`) names the axis that varies, and the
 * `is*` guards narrow on `run.via` cleanly.

 * - `RESTORE` — a {@link import('./factories.js').restoreWorkflow} given a structurally
 *   invalid {@link WorkflowSnapshot} (a status outside the lifecycle vocabulary).
 * - `DEPTH` — a nested-workflow dispatch (W-c2) that the runner's depth / cycle guard
 *   rejected: running it would push the nested-workflow chain past
 *   {@link import('./constants.js').MAX_WORKFLOW_DEPTH}, OR its target agent (or a
 *   workflow it would author) is already an ancestor of the current run (a re-entry
 *   cycle). Raised on BOTH seams of the W-c2 recursion — an `agent`-task dispatch
 *   (`fail`ed with this code; it never runs) AND the
 *   {@link import('./factories.js').createWorkflowTool} handler (thrown, then ISOLATED
 *   by the `@orkestrel/agent` package's `ToolManager` into the tool
 *   result's `error`). The error `context` names the offending agent / workflow id + the depth.
 * - `TOOL` — the {@link import('./factories.js').createWorkflowTool} handler was handed
 *   a MALFORMED / over-constraint authored args blob (e.g. an empty `id`, `concurrency: 0`)
 *   that the contract rejected, so no workflow ran. The handler THROWS it (rather than
 *   returning a failure result), and the `@orkestrel/agent` package's `ToolManager`
 *   ISOLATES the throw into the canonical tool result's top-level `error` (AGENTS §14 — the
 *   universal tool-handler contract); the error `context` names the wrapped workflow id.
 * - `MUTATION` — a GATED structural or patch edit was refused: a duplicate id on
 *   `append`/`add`, a target that does not exist or is not `pending`, an out-of-bounds
 *   `index`, a patch that failed shaper validation, or a live structural edit refused by
 *   the NATIVE bottom-up gate — a terminal container, an edit targeting (or destined for)
 *   a position BEFORE the container's own pending-suffix boundary, or (a running phase)
 *   anything other than a pure append. The manager /
 *   entity structural API (AGENTS §12) returns it as a graceful `Result` `failure` —
 *   it NEVER throws for this code except {@link TaskInterface.patch} /
 *   {@link PhaseInterface.patch}'s defense-in-depth self-check and the build-time
 *   {@link TaskManagerInterface.append} / {@link PhaseManagerInterface.append} duplicate-id

 *
 * @remarks
 * `execute` is single-source: it BUILDS the live tree from the definition internally (via
 * {@link import('./factories.js').createWorkflow}), so these options carry BOTH halves of
 * that one call —
 * - the **construction** half is {@link WorkflowOptions} (`on` initial listeners, the `bail`
 *   override, the per-node `phases` bag); `execute` forwards it straight to `createWorkflow`,
 *   so construction-time emitter listeners, a `bail` override, and per-node options all apply
 *   to the tree it builds (`createWorkflow` resolves `bail` as `options.bail ?? definition.bail
 *   ?? DEFAULT_BAIL`); and
 * - the **run-control** half is the three bounds below, used only for the run-level fold.
 *
 * The three bounds compose via `AbortSignal.any` (exactly as the agent runtime folds its
 * own): a fire of ANY of them cancels every in-flight task (its
 * {@link TaskControllerInterface.signal} fires) and HALTS the run — the remaining tasks
 * and phases are `skip`ped and the workflow settles `stopped`.
 * - `signal` — an external cancellation (a caller `AbortController`).
 * - `timeout` — a whole-run deadline in milliseconds. A non-positive value (`0` or negative)
 *   ⇒ NO deadline (the runner arms an `@orkestrel/timeout` `TimeoutInterface`
 *   only when `timeout > 0`).
 * - `budget` — a whole-run cost ceiling (a {@link BudgetInterface} over {@link TokenUsage}
 *   — its `signal` fires when a task-reported usage crosses `max`); the runner folds its
 *   `signal` and `start`s it. (A `max: 0` budget is exhausted from its first `start`, so it
 *   cancels the run at entry — a DIFFERENT primitive from the `timeout: 0` "no deadline" case.)
 *
 * The last two are the W-c2 DEPTH / CYCLE bookkeeping — the run's position in a nested
 * workflow→agent→workflow chain, threaded across the
 * `execute → agent-task → createWorkflowTool → nested execute` boundary so the guard can
 * bound recursion. A TOP-LEVEL `execute` omits both (depth `0`, empty ancestry); only the
 * runner-bound workflow tool ({@link import('./factories.js').createWorkflowTool}) supplies
 * them, incrementing the depth and extending the ancestry for each nested run.
 * - `depth` — the run's nesting depth (default `0`). An `agent` task is REJECTED (a typed
 *   `DEPTH` `task.fail`) when running it would push the chain past
 *   {@link import('./constants.js').MAX_WORKFLOW_DEPTH}.
 * - `ancestry` — the identifiers of the workflows + agents already in this run chain
 *   (e.g. `workflow:<id>` / `agent:<name>`). An `agent` task whose target agent — or the
 *   workflow it would author — is already present is a CYCLE and is likewise rejected.
