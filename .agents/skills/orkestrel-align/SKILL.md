description: Audit and improve how two or more Orkestrel packages, or their core, server, browser, and app environments, fit together. Use for coordinated package-stack refactors, cross-package extraction, developer-ergonomics reviews, end-to-end or live integration testing, dependency and guide alignment, and fleet/package-manager campaigns. Preserve host-independent core boundaries, update dependents topologically, and use the package-hardening workflow for each implementation unit.

# Load the canonical skill

This file is a pointer the `@orkestrel/scaffold` package writes into every fleet workspace; the
skill itself ships with that package. Read the canonical `SKILL.md` completely and follow it:

- beside a scaffold checkout, `../scaffold/.agents/skills/orkestrel-align/SKILL.md`;
- otherwise, `node_modules/@orkestrel/scaffold/dist/host/agents/skills/orkestrel-align/SKILL.md`.

Resolve every path the canonical skill names against the same root; under `node_modules` each
segment drops its opening dot. Run a script the skill names through its built twin, as this
repository's `AGENTS.md` states. This pointer carries no process of its own; the authority order is
`.agents/orchestration.md` § Authority.
